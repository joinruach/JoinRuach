## What is JoinRuach?

**JoinRuach** is the community, contribution, and collaboration hub for **Ruach Studios** — a faith-driven media and technology initiative restoring identity, purpose, and hope through storytelling, software, and systems.

We're building:
- **Faith-centered media** that reframes narratives of identity and purpose
