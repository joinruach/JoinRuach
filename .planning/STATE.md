## Accumulated Context

### Milestone v1.0: Formation Guidebook UI (Phases 1-7)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Use existing Next.js 16 App Router patterns (Server Components default)
- Leverage existing Formation Engine API (event sourcing backend)
- Integrate OpenAI Whisper for voice transcription (Phase 2)
- Keep XSS fixes integrated with feature work (not separate security phase)
- **Phase 1:** Unicode-safe word count with `[\p{L}\p{N}]` regex pattern
- **Phase 1:** Delta-based heartbeat accumulation with Redis sessions (attemptId scoping)
- **Phase 1:** Timestamp-based timer using performance.now() (no drift)
- **Phase 1:** Checkpoint-specific localStorage keys for draft isolation

**Scope Decisions:**
- Focus ONLY on Formation Guidebook UI (not LSS, Iron Chamber, or Ministry Works)
- Exclude gamification features (badges, leaderboards, streaks)
- Exclude community features (cohorts, mentorship, messaging)
- Include full feature set: voice input, AI routing, axiom unlocking

**Architecture:**
- Build on existing guidebook pages (apps/ruach-next/src/app/[locale]/guidebook/)
- Use existing SectionView.tsx as foundation for checkpoint form
- Call Formation Engine API via server actions
- Store reflections in formation-reflection content type (Strapi)

### Milestone v2.0: Multi-Camera Video Production (Phases 8-15)

**Core Paradigm:**
- Content compilation, not destructive editing
- Transcript = truth backbone
- EDL = intent (reproducible, auditable)
- Remotion = faithful executor
- All renders deterministic and scripture-safe

**Key Architecture Principles:**
- Separate normalization from sync (independent re-processing)
- Versioned EDLs (v1 AI, v2 human-edited, v3 final)
- Deterministic renders from (EDL + assets + version hash)
- Scripture overlays as first-class timeline events
- Full audit trail and reproducibility

**Stack Integration:**
- Strapi content modeling (recording-session, media-asset, edl, render-job)
- BullMQ async jobs (existing pattern)
- Whisper + Claude (existing services)
- Remotion for deterministic rendering
- R2 storage (existing integration)
- ruach-citation-validator (existing guardrails)

## Deferred Issues

**From v1.0:**
- Voice transcription quality depends on OpenAI Whisper reliability (Phase 2)
- AI routing logic complexity could cause edge cases (Phase 4)
- Cross-session persistence needs careful state management (all phases)

**From v2.0:**
- None yet - milestone just created

---

## Concerns & Risks

**From v1.0 CONCERNS.md:**
1. **XSS vulnerabilities** - 7 instances of dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization
   - Status: Known, will fix during implementation
   - Mitigation: Add DOMPurify sanitization when touching affected files

2. **Formation prerequisite validation non-functional** - returns hardcoded true/false
   - Status: Known, may need to implement for axiom unlocking (Phase 5)
   - Mitigation: Check if Formation Engine handles this, fix if needed

3. **Minimal test coverage** - only 10 test files for 318+ TS files
   - Status: Known, will add tests as we build new features
   - Mitigation: Target 80% coverage on new business logic

**New Risks for v2.0:**
- FFmpeg audio correlation accuracy (Phase 9) - mitigate with manual nudge UI
- AI EDL quality (Phase 11) - mitigate with versioned EDL workflow
- Remotion render performance (Phase 12) - mitigate with BullMQ worker scaling
- Scripture overlay timing accuracy (Phase 14) - mitigate with existing citation validator

## Alignment Status

**Project Goals:** ✅ Aligned
- v1.0: Formation Guidebook as core spiritual formation experience
- v2.0: Multi-camera production pipeline for Ruach Studios content
- Both milestones independent, composable, and aligned with overall platform vision

**User Expectations:** ✅ Aligned
- v1.0: Voice, routing, unlocking all included
- v2.0: 3-camera sync → AI EDL → human refinement → render → publish
- Clear separation between Formation (user journey) and Production (content creation)

**Technical Feasibility:** ✅ Aligned
- Backend infrastructure exists (Strapi, Formation Engine, BullMQ, event sourcing)
- Frontend foundation exists (Next.js, guidebook pages, Studio patterns)
- External dependencies available (OpenAI, Claude, Remotion, R2)
- Existing transcription and citation systems ready for reuse

## Roadmap Evolution

**Milestones Created:**
- v1.0 Formation Guidebook UI: 7 phases (Phases 1-7), Phase 1 complete
- v2.0 Multi-Camera Video Production: 8 phases (Phases 8-15), created 2026-02-03

**Continuous Phase Numbering:**
- Phases 1-7: Formation Guidebook (v1.0)
- Phases 8-15: Multi-Camera Production (v2.0)
- Future milestones will continue from Phase 16+

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-02-03 12:41 PST
**Stopped at:** Milestone v2.0 initialization complete
**Resume file:** None

**Next up:** Phase 8 planning
- Option 1: `/gsd:discuss-phase 8` - gather context first
- Option 2: `/gsd:research-phase 8` - investigate Strapi schema patterns (unlikely needed)
- Option 3: `/gsd:plan-phase 8` - create execution plan directly

**Recommended:** `/gsd:plan-phase 8` (standard Strapi patterns, no research needed)
