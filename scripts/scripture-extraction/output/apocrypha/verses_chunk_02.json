My grandfather Yahoshua, when he had applied himself greatly to the reading of the Law, and the neḇi’im, and other Books of our fathers, and had acquired good judgment from them, was himself also led to write somewhat pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those who desire to learn, and are drawn to such, might profit much more in living according to the Law. Therefore let me plead that you read it with good intent and attention, and to pardon us for where we may seem to come short in some words, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same words spoken in Iḇri, and translated into another tongue, do not have the same force in them; and not only this, but the Law itself, and the neḇi’im, and the rest of the Books, have great difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the thirty-eighth year of coming into Mitsrayim, when Euergetĕs was sovereign, and continuing there some time, I found a book of great learning; therefore I thought it necessary for me to devote some diligence and labour to interpret it; using great vigilance and skill in that time to complete the book, and also publish it for those in a foreign land who are willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live after the Law. 1108",
